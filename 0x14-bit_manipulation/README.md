Bit Manipulation
Each file in this repository holds code that illustrates an essential concept of programming, specific to the C programming language: how to manipulate bits via switiching them on and off, getting them, and printing to/from binary

Description of what each file shows:
main_test_files ----- folder holds test files that showcase examples of how to use functions
holberton.h ---------- holds files' function prototypes
Files that start with:
a function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int
a function that prints the binary of a number without using / or %
a function that returns the value of a bit at a given index
a function that sets the value of a bit to 1 at a given index
a function that sets the value of a bit to 0 at a given index
a function that returns the number of bits you would need to flip to get from one number to another
a function that checks for big endian and little endian
